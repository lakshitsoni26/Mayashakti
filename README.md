> MayaShakti channels the spirit of Hindu mythology where **Maya (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ)** represents illusion and **Shakti (‡§∂‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ø)** symbolizes divine power. This project uses the Gemini AI to combat misinformation, resolve grievances with empathy, and provide a layer of truth over our digital reality.

### üö® **CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING** üö®

This project is currently a **frontend-only application** and is **NOT secure for production**.

-   üîí **API Key Exposure**: The Gemini API key is handled on the client-side, making it publicly visible. To deploy this application securely, you **MUST** refactor it to use a backend server that protects the API key.
-   üë§ **Simulated Authentication**: The user login system is a simulation using `localStorage` and is **not secure**. A real backend with a database is required for production user management.
